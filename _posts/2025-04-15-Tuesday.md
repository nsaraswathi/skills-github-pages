# Beat the heat
To stay safe and comfortable during hot weather, prioritize hydration by drinking plenty of fluids, wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, and seek shade when outdoors.

## Stay Hydrated
Drink water regularly, even if you don't feel thirsty, to prevent dehydration. You can also opt for other hydrating beverages like coconut water, buttermilk, or fruit juices, according to a Reddit post about staying cool in Bangalore. 
## Dress Lightly
Choose lightweight, light-colored, and loose-fitting clothing made from breathable fabrics like cotton to help regulate body temperature. 
## Seek Shade
Find shaded areas or stay indoors during the hottest parts of the day, especially between 10 am and 4 pm when the sun's rays are strongest.
